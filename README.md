## Fade Out a Control on a Form\.


</div>

### Description

A user in a newsgroup was asking how they can get the effect of fading out a control on a form. They knew how to fade a form (as I think we all do by all the transparent demo projects on this site). The poster however just wanted to fade out a control on a given form and have it fade away to nothing. So, I put this project together real quick as a starting point for him/her to see one way it could be done. I will tell you now, it is really just fancy API work to move the control off the form to another and fading that new form but it gives the effect the poster was asking for. Just thought I would share for everyone else here and to give him/her a link of where to come and see the code. KEYWORDS: TRANSPARENT, FADE, SETWINDOWLONG, SETLAYEREDWINDOWATTRIBUTES
